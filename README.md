THIS IS A SIMPLE TEMPERATURE MONITORING SYSTEM TASK,IN THIS I  DESIGN A WORKING SYSTEM THAT CAN SENSE THE SURROUNDING TEMPERATURE USING A SENSOR AND DISPLAY THE READINGS IN 16*2 LCD DISPLAY.THE SYSTEM IS BUILT USING A AURDINO UNO BOARD,WHICH IS AN OPEN SOURCE MICROCONTROLLER PALTFORM WIDELY USED FOR PROTOTYPING EMBEDDED APPLICATIONS.I USED TEMP36 SENSOR TO SENSE THE TEMPERATURE.THE TEMP36 IS A WIDELY AVAILABLE,THAT OUTPUTS VOLTAGE LINEARLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE CELSIUS TEMPERATURE.IT HAS THREE PINS:VCC,GND,AND OUTPUT.THE SENSOR OUTPUTS 10 MILLIVOLTS PER DEGREE CELSIUS,MAKING IT EASY TO CONVERT THE ANALOG READING FROM THE AURDINO INTO A READABLE TEMPERATURE VALUE.THE AURDINO READS THE VOLTAGE FROM THE SENSOR USING THE  FUNCTION WHICH PROVIDES A VALUE FROM 0 TO 1023.THIS VALUE IS THEN CONVERTED INTO VOLTAGE BY MULTIPLYING IT WITH A FACTOR OF 5.0/1023.0,AS  THE AURDINO ADC WITH A 5V REFERENCE.THE TEMPERATURE IN CELSIUS IS THEN CALCULATED BY MULTIPLYING THE VOLTAGE VALUE BY 100.THIS CONVERSION LOGIC IS IMPLEMENTED IN THE AURDINO SKETCH,AND  THE RESULT IS PRINTED TO THE SERIAL MONITOR.THE SERIAL MONITOR IS USED AS A SIMPLE WAY TO VIEW THE TEMPERATURE DATA IN REAL-TIME.FOR USERS WHO PREFER A PHYSICAL DISPLAY,THE SAME TEMPERATURE DATA CAN ALSO BE SHOWN ON AN LCD SCREEN.THE COMPONENTS USED ARE AURDINO,16*2 LCD,CONNECTING WIRES,TEMPERATURE SENSOR,CONNECTING WIRES,POTENTIOMETER(FOR LCD CONTRAST).THE TEMPERATURE SENSORED WAS SHOWN IN LCD DISPLAY.I HAVE DELIVERED THE  AURDINO CODE,CIRCUIT DIAGRAM AND TEMPERATURE VALUE FILES IN GITHUB.I HAVE LEARNED THE HOW THE TEMPERATURE IS MONITORED USING AN ONLINE PLATFORM TINKERCAD.I LEARNED HOW TO INTERFACE ANALOG SENSORS WITH A MICROCONTROLLER,HOW TO READ ANALOG VALUES,AND HOW TO CONVERT THEM INTO MEANINGFUL DATA.I ALSO LEARNED HOW TO DISPLAY THE DATA ON BOTH SERIAL MONITOR AND LCD DISPLAY.THIS PROJECT HELPED  ME STRENGTHEN MY SKILLS IN SENSOR INTERFACING,ANALOG DATA HANDLING,CIRCUIT DESIGN, AND EMBEDDED PROGRAMMING.IT IS ONE OF THE KEY TASKS THAT CONTRIBUTES TO MY UNDERSTANDING OF RAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS IN THE FIELD OF EMBEDDED SYSTEMS.THE OUTPUT IS SHOWN BELOW WHICH SHOWS THE TEMPERATURE VALUE IN LCD DISPLAY.
